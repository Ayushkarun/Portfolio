            <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);" >Hello! I'm a driven professional with a dual focus: a part-time swing trader in the equity segment and a software engineer with
                experience in MSSQL. Over the past year, I have honed my technical skills as a Software Engineer Trainee, specializing
                in database management and optimization using MSSQL. This experience has equipped me with a foundation in problem-solving and system efficiency.
                
                In parallel, my interest in the financial markets led me to pursue swing trading, where I apply analytical and strategic
                thinking to identify profitable opportunities. This dual expertise reflects my adaptability and passion for learning
                across domains.
                
                I'm excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities that leverage my skills in technology
                and finance. Let's collaborate to create impactful solutions!.</p>
